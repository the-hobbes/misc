	Robert ... needs a key that is an anagram of a certain palindrome string.	
	The king has a string composed of lowercase English letters. Help him figure 
	out if any anagram of the string can be a palindrome or not

	Input Format 
	A single line which contains the input string

	Constraints 
	1<=length of string <= 10^5 
	Each character of the string is a lowercase English letter.

	Output Format 
	A single line which contains YES or NO in uppercase.

	Anagram:
	An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce 
	a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example Torchwood can be rearranged 
	into Doctor Who.

	Palindrome:
	A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or 
	forward.
